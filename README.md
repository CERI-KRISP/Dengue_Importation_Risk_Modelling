Abstract 
The dengue virus is a significant global public health concern that poses a potential threat to Africa where limited reporting and diagnostic capacity hinder a comprehensive assessment of continent-wide transmission dynamics. By integrating temperature dependent theoretical transmission potential and air travel data into a recently developed risk flow metric, we map regions at high risk of importing dengue into airports in Africa and contribute to informing arbovirus surveillance and prevention strategies in Africa.

Methods: The risk of importation of dengue to Africa from countries of high dengue incidence was estimated based on origin-destination air travel flows and dengue epidemic activity at origin. We created a novel proxy for local dengue epidemic activity by creating a composite index obtained from combining theoretical climate-driven transmission potential with population density, which we used, along with travel information, to estimate the importation risk into African airports from 14 high-incidence countries in South America and Asia. 

Result: The study reveals distinctive patterns of dengue importation into Africa, emphasising the varying risks associated with travellers from Southeast Asia, South Asia, and South America. We highlight the complex interplay between regional travel, population density and ecological factors in shaping the overall risk of importation landscape which varies depending on dengue transmission potential synchrony across the world. Generally, we find that countries in the eastern African region are faced with higher risk of dengue importation from Southeast Asia, whereas for western African countries, larger risk of importation is estimated from South America. Some countries demonstrated high risk of importation, however, estimated low local transmission potential likely hampers the chances that importations lead to local establishment and wide-spread transmission. 

Conclusions: In this study, we have identified high-risk areas in Africa for potential dengue outbreaks. Specifically, Mauritius, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Kenya are identified as countries susceptible to dengue introductions during periods of persistent transmission suitability. Even though surveillance capacity has improved substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling African nations to improve their local response to dengue outbreaks, our work improves the data driven allocation of surveillance resources, in high-risk regions. These will be critical in detecting and managing imported cases.
